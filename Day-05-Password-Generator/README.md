# Day 5: Password Generator

This is a Python script that generates a random, strong password based on user-specified criteria for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **`for` Loops:** Using loops with the `range()` function to iterate a specific number of times.
* **`random` Module:** Using `random.choice()` to select a random element from a list and `random.shuffle()` to randomize the order of items in a list.
* **List Manipulation:** Appending items to a list to build up the password components.
* **String Concatenation:** Using a loop to join a list of characters into a final string.
