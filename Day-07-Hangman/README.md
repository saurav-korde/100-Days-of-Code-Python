# Day 7: Hangman

This is a command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. The program randomly selects a word, and the player must guess it letter by letter before they run out of lives.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Game Loop:** Using a `while` loop to keep the game running until a win or lose condition is met.
* **`for` Loops:** Iterating through the letters of the chosen word to check the player's guess.
* **List Manipulation:** Using a list to represent the game board (the hidden word with underscores) and updating it as the user guesses correctly.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `if/else` statements to check if a guess is correct, if the player has already guessed a letter, or if the game is over.
* **Combining Concepts:** Integrating loops, lists, and conditionals into a single, functioning program.
