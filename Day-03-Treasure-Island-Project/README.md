# Day 3: Treasure Island

This is a simple text-based "choose your own adventure" game. The player makes a series of choices to navigate through a story and try to find the treasure.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of the program based on user input.
* **Nested Conditionals:** Placing `if/else` statements inside other `if/else` statements to create branching paths in the story.
* **String Manipulation:** Using the `.lower()` method to make user input case-insensitive, improving the user experience.
