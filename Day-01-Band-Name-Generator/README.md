# Day 1: Band Name Generator

This is the first project from Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course. The program asks the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, then combines them to create a band name.

## What I Learned
* How to use the `print()` and `input()` functions in Python.
* Basic string concatenation.
