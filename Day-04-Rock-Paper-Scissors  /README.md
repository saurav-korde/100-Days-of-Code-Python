# Day 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a command-line version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" where the user plays against the computer, which makes a random choice.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Random Module:** Using the `random` module in Python to generate random integers (`random.randint()`) for the computer's move.
* **Python Lists:** Storing data (in this case, ASCII art) in a list and accessing specific items using their index.
* **Index-Based Logic:** Mapping numerical choices (0, 1, 2) to specific game options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) using list indices.
* **Complex Conditionals:** Building a series of `if/elif/else` statements to handle all the win, lose, and draw conditions of the game.
